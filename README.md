# MatPrint
This Repository includes the necessary code that is needed to replicate the work done in the paper "Introducing Materials Fingerprint (MatPrint): a novel method in graphical material representation and features compression";
1. "MatPrint - Documented Code.ipynb" contains the Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code that performs the compression and de-compression of the csv features and the graphical representations respectively, more documentation is added in the notebook to calrify each section
2. "features.txt" contains the necessary features for the de-compression stage, that is needed to identify the features that have been transformed from images to csv.
3. "sample_example.csv" contains 20 random materials obtained from the AFLOW Database which features' are generated by Magpie and are used to generate the graphical representation of those materials.
4. "ResNet-18 model.py" is a pretrained ResNet-18 model that is used alongside data from "form_en_values" folder in the unzipped "form_en_values.rar"on energy  file, the model is a regression model that predicts the formation energy of new compounds based on the MatPrint graphical represntation. #code written by Surjeet Kumar
5. "form_en_values.rar" contains the folder "form_en_values" which holds 2021 compounds with their formation energy in eV/atom in the filename as labels.
